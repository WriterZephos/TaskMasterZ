# TaskMasterZ
A simple homework/chores tracker app.

## Introduction

I built this app using Java and the Swing GUI library to help me manage my homework and other chores in college. It categorized tasks based on what class they are for, and you could sort tasks by priority, due date, etc. Completed task would be hidden unless you wanted to see them, and tasks were color coded based on how close they were to their due date.

You can download the app [here](https://github.com/WriterZephos/TaskMasterZ/raw/master/TaskMaster.jar) (Jar executable).
